# MoneyFi SDK

A TypeScript SDK for interacting with **MoneyFi strategies across multiple blockchain networks**, providing seamless integration for DeFi operations including deposits, withdrawals, and account management.

This library provides **ready-to-use transaction payloads** and API methods so frontend dApps can integrate **deposit**, **withdraw**, **user management**, and **statistics** features with various blockchain wallets.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
npm install @moneyfi/ts-sdk
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Import & Initialize

```typescript
import type { UserStatistic } from '@moneyfi/ts-sdk';
import { MoneyFi } from '@moneyfi/ts-sdk';

// Initialize SDK
const moneyFi = new MoneyFi("integration_code");
```

### 2. Basic Usage Example

```typescript
// Create or get user
const user = await moneyFi.createUser({
  user_address: 'your-wallet-address',
});

// Check if wallet account exists
const hasAccount = await moneyFi.hasWalletAccount({
  sender: 'your-wallet-address'
});

// Get deposit transaction payload
const depositPayload = await moneyFi.getDepositTxPayload({
  chain_id: CHAIN_ID.APTOS,
  sender: 'your-wallet-address',
  token_address: 'token-contract-address',
  amount: BigInt(1000)
});
```

**Parameters**
- `params: TxPayloadWithdrawParam` â†’ Tx payload withdrawal parameters

**Returns**
- `Promise<TxPayloadWithdrawResponse>` â†’  Raw transaction bytes (BCS-encoded) ready for signing & submitting.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ reqWithdraw(address, payload)

Initiates an off-chain withdraw request.
The request is verified using a signature + public key and then processed by the MoneyFi backend.
You can later track its progress with getWithdrawStatus.

**Parameters**
- `address: string` â†’ User wallet address
- `payload: ReqWithdrawPayload` â†’ Withdrawal request details

**Parameters**
- `params: UserStaticsParam` â†’ User statics param

**Returns**
- `Promise<UserStatistic>` â†’ User statistics and performance data

---

#### ðŸ”¹ getSupportedChains()

Lists all supported blockchain networks.

**Returns**
- `Promise<SupportedChains>` â†’ Available chains and their configurations

---

#### ðŸ”¹ getSupportedTokens()

Lists all supported tokens across networks.

**Returns**
- `Promise<SupportedTokens>` â†’ Available tokens and their details

---

#### ðŸ”¹ getUserInformation(address)

## Frontend Integration Flow
### User Management
1. Use `createUser(payload)` to register new users if not exist
2. Call `hasWalletAccount(params)` to check wallet account exist in Aptos
3. Use `getTxInitializationWalletAccount(params)` if wallet account setup is needed in Aptos and then submit the signed transaction to the blockchain

### Deposit Flow
1. Call `getDepositTxPayload(params)` with deposit details
2. Pass returned payload to the connected wallet for user signing
3. Submit the signed transaction to the blockchain
4. Monitor transaction status

### Withdrawal Flow
1. Call `reqWithdraw(address, payload)` for off-chain processing
2. Use `getWithdrawStatus(address)` to monitor withdrawal progress
3. Call `getWithdrawTxPayload(params)` for on-chain withdrawal
4. Pass returned payload to the connected wallet for user signing
5. Submit the signed transaction to the blockchain
6. Monitor transaction status

### Claim referral reward Flow
1. Call `getWithdrawTxPayload(params)` for on-chain withdrawal
2. Pass returned payload to the connected wallet for user signing
3. Submit the signed transaction to the blockchain
4. Monitor transaction status

### User Information
1. Call `getUserStatistic(params)` to retrieve a userâ€™s investment analytics.
2. Use `getUserInformation(address)` to retrieve a userâ€™s general information.

### Supported chains and tokens
1. Call `getSupportedChains()` to retrieve list of supported chain.
2. Use `getSupportedTokens()` to retrieve list of supported token.
